this code uses bit manipulation and the heap can:
build min heapheapify when we build the heap and when we poped
we can pop the root and re heapify 
the heap can have anything since it uses python lists eg 3 3.5 etc 


example:

min heap: [1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 6, 6, 9, 10, 9.4, 12, 8.3]
after insert [0.1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6, 9, 10, 9.4, 12, 8.3, 6]
poped root: 0.1
Heap now [2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3, 1, 6, 9, 10, 9.4, 12, 8.3]
