1. Implement the solutions and upload it to github
Done :)

2. Prove the time complexity of the algorithms
we are only using while loops to go through each array. the function takes in 3 arrays with legnth A B C. 
since we go through each array only once our time complecity is O(A+B+C) => O(n) where n = max(A,B,C) so this is
a linear proboblem if we had a unsorted array the algo would need to be changed 


3. Comment on way's you could improve your implementation (you don't need to do it just discuss it)

we can make it sort K arrays and not just three. we could also shorted the code to make it more readable by using just 1 while loop
this will also make small impomvemts on the avergae amount of instruction but overall little impact to how long 
it takes to run
