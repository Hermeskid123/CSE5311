1. Implement the solutions and upload it to github
done :)

2. Prove the time complexity of the algorithms

we have one for loop doing for  i in range(0, l-1) where l is the len of the input arr 
this means that our time complexity is O(n) where n is the size of the input array since we only iterate through it once. 


3. Comment on way's you could improve your implementation (you don't need to do it just discuss it)
I am useing append in python this could be replaced with somthing that is faster and doest take up as much space
